o Version 1.4.00
   Added SUB-WT Package
   GMG -- Added adaptive damping option as documented in "GMG_Damping.pdf"
       and "Banta_damping_paper.pdf" in the doc directory.
   GWF2LAK7 -- Corrected precision declaration for functions FINTERP,
       DERIVTERP, and OUTFLWTERP.

o Version 1.3.01
   GWF2BAS7 -- MXPAR, the maximum number of parameters, increased fromm
       500 to 999.

o Version 1.3
   GWF2GAG7 -- Removed duplicate reference to RNF in USE statement in
       subroutine SGWF2GAG7LO.  Modifications to format statements.
   GWF2UZF1 -- Fixed memory allocation problem when using UZF to simulate
       discharge to land surface while not simulating unsaturated flow.
       The calculation was changed for simulating head-dependent recharge
       and discharge when the ground-water head is near or above land
       surface.
   GWF2SFR7 -- Fixed logic for reading mixed parameter and nonparameter
       input data.
   GWF2SFR7 -- Fixed problem where FLOWC was uninitialized when ICALC=0.
       Added ability for SFR to be used with HUF.
   GWF2RCH7, GWF2EVT7, GWF2ETS7 -- Added a check to not use the layer
       indicator value if the indicator value is 0.
   OBS2BAS7 -- Changed format for saving observations in a disk file to
       write less digits..
   OBS2BAS7 -- Fixed problem with head-change observations at cells that
       have an initally dry simulated value, but values at later time are
       wet.  The later values were being computed based on the dry value,
       and now all of the values at later times will be dry.

o Version 1.2.01  10/24/2006
   GWF2SFR7 -- A bug was discovered in SFR7 when NSTRM is postive or when
       NSTRM is negative and ISFROPT is 0. The error  occurs because record
       6 is not read after the first stress period. This causes the read
       sequence following stress period 2 to be incorrect. Many different
       problems can occur due to this bug, including stopping of the model.

o Version 1.2  10/16/2006
   Added SFR, LAK, UZF, and GAG Packages
   GWF2MNW7 -- Converted PLOSS to double precision
   DE47 -- Added missing arguments in the call from MAIN to DE47AP
   KDEP capability in GWF2HUF2 -- Corrected memory allocation for GS array
          when IFKDEP is 0.
   GWF2DRT7 -- A bug that caused a budget error when a drain-return cell 
       is inactive has been fixed.  Now, if the return cell is inactive
       (IBOUND=0) or constant-head (IBOUND<0), no return flow takes place,
       and all drain flow exits the model.  Also a bug that caused an error
       reading non-parameter data was fixed.
   GWF2SUB7 -- Modified to allow comment lines to be inserted into the SUB
       input file anywhere except where arrays are to be read by one of the
       array-reader subroutines (U2DREL or U2DINT).

Note to users of the Hydraulic-Conductivity Depth-Dependence (KDEP) capability:
The memory allocation error for the GS array exists in the KDEP code
beginning with its first release in version 1.12 of MODFLOW-2000 (MF2K)
and continuing through version 1.15 of MF2K. The error was fixed beginning
with version 1.16. The error also occurs in versions 1.0 and 1.1 of
MODFLOW-2005.  The error has been found to cause problems in some (but not all)
models that specify input variable IFKDEP equal to 0. Variable IFKDEP is a flag
indicating the source of the array specifying reference-surface elevations used
for the depth-dependent hydraulic-conductivity calculations. When IFKDEP = 0,
the TOP array specified in the Discretization Package Input File is used; when
IFKDEP = 1, the array is specified in the KDEP input file (variable RS). In
some circumstances, specification of IFKDEP = 0 led to inadequate allocation
of memory for the reference surface.  The error could cause errors in some of
the budget calculations.  Models that specify IFKDEP = 1 should not be affected
by this error.  If users are uncertain whether their simulations using KDEP are
affected by this error, they are encouraged to run their data sets with MF2K
version 1.16 (or higher) or MODFLOW-2005 version 1.2 (or higher) and compare the
new results with those of the earlier version.


o Version 1.1  05/18/2006
   SGWF2LPF7DA -- Corrected deallocation statements for several variables
   hufutl7.f -- Removed some unused code
   De47.f -- Moved several variables into DE4MODULE to support Local Grid
             Refinement (LGR)
   GWF2BAS7AR -- added MFVNAM as an argument to allow different versions of
                 MODFLOW to print a different version name -- e.g. MODFLOW-LGR
                 as opposed to MODFLOW-2005.
   Added DRT, ETS, RES, and SUB packages
   Added Observation (OBS) Process
   GWF2MNW7RP -- Corrected HDRY value when HUF is used
              -- Fixed initialization problem with variable ICMN.
   GWF2MNW7 -- Added an 18th element to the WELL2 list to store a well
               identifier
   GWF2STR7 -- Increased the number of digits for output of streamflow terms
               in the Listing File.

o Version 1.00 01/15/2006:

This version is the initial release.
